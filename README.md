👋 Hi, I’m @merve-karagulle — a passionate and curious Software Engineering student driven by the power of technology to create impactful, real-world solutions.
💻 I specialize in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL), database design & optimization, and interactive front-end experiences.
🔌 I also love exploring the world of Arduino programming using Tinkercad, building smart systems and simulations that combine creativity with hardware logic.

🌱 Currently, I’m deepening my skills in:

⚙️ Advanced web technologies (React, RESTful APIs, full-stack architecture)

🗄️ Efficient database structures and performance tuning

🛠️ Arduino-based automation projects with sensors and motor control

💡 I enjoy designing sleek, functional web interfaces, optimizing backend systems, and prototyping hardware projects that solve real-world problems — from line-following robots to multi-motor platforms.

🤝 I’m always excited to collaborate on projects related to:

🌐 Modern and accessible web applications

🧠 Innovative front-end design

🧩 Smart systems using Arduino + sensors

💾 Powerful database-driven platforms
